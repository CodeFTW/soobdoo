1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,800
So, you know in horror movies when the girl's like,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,270
"Oh, my god. There's something in the basement.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,510
Let me just run down there in my underwear

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,940
and see what's going on, in the dark."

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,880
And you're like, "What is your problem?! Call the police!"

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,680
And she's like, "Okay," But it's too late,

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,450
Because she's already getting murdered.

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,720
Well, uh... my story's kind of like that.

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,090
It's a surprise for Spencer.

10
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm just gonna walk in, and I'm gonna drop my coat on the ground.

11
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,670
He says he has this fantasy

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,200
that I'm a stripper with a heart of gold

13
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,490
and he's helping me put myself through college.

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,470
He didn't say the college part, did he?

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,580
Um, no. I-I wanted to create a 3-dimensional sex character.

16
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,700
Really? What's your stripper name?

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,070
Uh... Rebecca Johnson.

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,510
Your stripper name's Rebecca Johnson?

19
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,450
Boobies Johnson. T-two boobs Johnson.

20
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,700
Look at you, in the back of a cab, totally naked.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,880
I am so proud of you.

22
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,960
Hello?

23
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,670
I came home early.

24
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,330
Jess! What...

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,440
Who's Jess?

26
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,290
You're talking to...

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,450
Tiger Boobs.

28
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,650
I'm doing sexy things

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,490
With a pillow

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,430
This...

31
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,220
She's doin' sexy stuff

32
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,580
To the plant right...

33
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,500
Okay.

34
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,310
I'll pick that up later

35
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,830
Who's that girl??

36
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,980
Who's that g-I-I-I-irl?

37
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,500
It's Jess!

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,350
That's why I need a new apartment.

39
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,370
I'm sorry. What was the question, again?

40
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,490
Do you have any pets?

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,670
You know, it's funny.

42
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,200
When I saw your ad on craigslist,

43
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,340
I thought you were women.

44
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,990
Why would you think that? That's crazy.

45
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,070
I mean, well, I made the...

46
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,010
Schmidt wrote the ad.

47
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,570
Oh, I guess it was something about the words you used.

48
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,420
It was like, uh, like...

49
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,250
"Sun-soaked and beige-y."

50
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,850
What are you doing?

51
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,620
What about these? These look beige-y to you?

52
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,470
Sorry.

53
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,130
I'm his trainer, so, uh...

54
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,350
It's kind of the house that Coach built right here.

55
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,040
What are we looking at here? That's baby-smooth.

56
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,800
This is L.L.S.... "Ladies love Schmidt."

57
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,420
What?! What did you just say?

58
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,810
Go put a dollar in the jar right now.

59
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,310
- Are you serious?
- Yeah! Now!

60
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,340
Damn it.

61
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,890
"L.L.S."? What is wrong with you?

62
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,880
This place is beautiful. It gets so much light.

63
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,120
Spencer hated light.

64
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,130
It's hard to say his name.

65
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,450
It's okay. Nick knows. He got dumped.

66
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,320
"Dumped"? Yeah, I got dumped.

67
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,160
I can't hear you! That means we're not breaking up!

68
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,870
- Yes, we're breaking up.
- We can't break up if I can't hear you!

69
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,020
I'm breaking up with you.

70
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,250
I need some time away...

71
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,360
Yeah, I got dumped.

72
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:07,870
She dumped me.

73
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,970
And I'm over it.

74
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,470
Okay? It was six months ago, guys.

75
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,670
Get past it!

76
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,460
I don't even know why we're still talking about it!

77
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,130
Why is everybody looking at me?!

78
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,000
You know what? I want to live here.

79
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,090
Actually, I-I still have some questions.

80
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,520
I mean, like, no offense, but we barely know you.

81
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,040
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

82
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,320
So, um... full disclosure.

83
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,550
I'm kind of emotional right now 'cause of the breakup,

84
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,880
So I'll probably be watching "Dirty Dancing"

85
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,470
at least six or seven times a day.

86
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,670
Um, I'm a teacher,

87
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,180
so I-I bring home a lot of popsicle sticks,

88
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,430
stuff like that.

89
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,130
Also, I like to sing to myself a lot.

90
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,700
A lot

91
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,900
I'm tired of living with my friend.

92
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,940
She's a model. All her friends are models.

93
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,580
Uh, how soon can you move in?

94
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,140
- Actually, Schmidt, slow up.
- Not happening.

95
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,800
Okay, uh, can you give us a second?

96
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,320
I just got to... got to talk to my boys.

97
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,260
"My boys" is not a thing around here.

98
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,160
- My bros, okay?
- Okay, douchebag jar.

99
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,670
For what? For "My bros"?

100
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,240
I'm gonna say yes. Her friends are models.

101
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,940
Okay, you guys? Models.

102
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,030
I say no.

103
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,180
I need to be able to come home from work, sit on my couch,

104
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:13,890
and let my beans out!

105
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,000
Nick, it's all you, buddy.

106
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,870
Well, first, let me say

107
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,760
I think you guys make some really interesting points,

108
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,710
Points that I respect, but I will say this.

109
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,260
I have lived with a woman... Caroline, as you guys know...

110
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,550
And so I know that there are pros

111
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,000
and I know that there are real cons, guys.

112
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:27,770
Nick, you're weak!

113
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,020
Okay, pro... they smell nice.

114
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,260
Cons...

115
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,200
Every once in a while, the mood changes,

116
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,630
and you're not sure why.

117
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,980
They'll ruin your life if you let them.

118
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,270
They'll break down your will to live.

119
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,880
Pros... they're really good at folding.

120
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,430
- Make a decision!
- I'm sorry. You know what?

121
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,770
But, like, another pro... like, when you, like...

122
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,960
Oh, don't do it. Don't do it. Put it down.

123
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,190
Don't... don't hood me.

124
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,250
You guys don't know what you're talking about.

125
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,840
Don't hood me. Please don't hood me.

126
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,970
Okay. I know what I'm talking about.

127
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,030
Okay. Pushed him too hard.

128
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,860
We did pushed him too hard. Damn it.

129
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,710
How about this? Executive decision... she's in.

130
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,460
Yay! I'm in!

131
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,720
You are not gonna regret this.

132
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,450
What have you done, Schmidt?

133
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,640
I got to go mom.

134
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,070
No, I'm not watching "Dirty Dancing."

135
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,610
No, I don't think so.

136
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,470
Hey, are you gonna murder me

137
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,360
'cause you're a stranger I met on the internet?

138
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,230
Yes, I am.

139
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,520
He says no.

140
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,100
No, look, I got to go, okay?

141
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,870
All right. Love you. Bye.

142
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,540
So, the wild west party's on Saturday.

143
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,540
I'm trying to get us in, but...

144
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,530
You may need to call Caroline.

145
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,450
I'm not calling caroline.

146
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,780
- Now, hear me out...
- Shh!

147
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,450
Had the time of my life

148
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,840
We are in this situation because of you.

149
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,270
I hate your face, Spencer! I love you!

150
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,620
It has been a week of this madness.

151
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,620
I'm going crazy, Schmidt. I can't take it.

152
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,570
You know what? I got this.

153
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,150
Hi, Coach.

154
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,480
Stop it.

155
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,460
Stop!

156
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,440
Schmidt!

157
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,040
Okay. All right.

158
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,240
I got us into this. I'm gonna get us out.

159
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,790
Jess, I'm gonna take the remote.

160
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,780
All right. All right. Hey, Jess.

161
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,110
How you doin'?

162
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,600
Listen, what if you came out with us tonight?

163
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,960
You know, after work.

164
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,260
You know, we'll fix you up. We'll take you out.

165
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,850
We'll get you a rebound.

166
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,440
A rebound?

167
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,370
Yeah.

168
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,520
I don't know if I'm ready.

169
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,900
You're totally ready for it.

170
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,650
I'll take you through the whole thing.

171
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,430
You know, I'll be... I'll be like your guide.

172
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,750
Like Gandalf through middle earth?

173
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,290
Probably not like...

174
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,830
Okay, first of all, let's just...

175
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,710
Let's take the "Lord of the rings" references...

176
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,840
Let's put them in a deep, dark cave, okay,

177
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,430
where no one's gonna find them... ever.

178
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,830
Except Smeagol.

179
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,490
He lives in a cave.

180
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,820
You know what, Jess? Come on.

181
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,750
Let's just take the head off the... off the couch.

182
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,690
Come on. Sit up, girl.

183
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,870
There you go.

184
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,250
Look at that. Doesn't that feel good?

185
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,070
There we go.

186
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,570
I think that sounds nice.

187
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,010
She's goin' out to find a rebound

188
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,090
Who's that girl? It's Jess!

189
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,870
Wait. Did you just make up a theme song for yourself?

190
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,900
I-I'm gonna fix it.

191
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,150
I'm not calling my ex-girlfriend to get you into a party.

192
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,140
This party is everything to me.

193
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,340
Please, Nick. We go every year.

194
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,490
You have no idea what I'm going through at work.

195
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,130
I'm just trying to do my work!

196
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,520
I'm trying to do a good job here!

197
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,410
Nice tie. Can I borrow a tampon?

198
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,580
- Schmidt, I'm not calling her.
- Listen to me.

199
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,750
Knowing every year that I will be going

200
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,060
to the wild wild west charity auction for poverty

201
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,130
reminds me that no matter what, I'm still a man.

202
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,020
And I can still motorboat a hot girl

203
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,700
who is also a member of the cherokee nation,

204
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,420
Which is not racist, because it is for a good cause.

205
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,520
Somebody's in here!

206
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,700
We're leaving in 10 minutes. Did you shave your legs?

207
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:02,990
I will now.

208
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,570
Front and backs?

209
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,240
- Yes.
- Thank you.

210
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,470
- I'm gonna kill myself now.
- Just call Caroline.

211
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,120
You call her all the time when you're drunk.

212
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,670
I-I don't know to what you are referring.

213
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,590
'Ello, Caroline.

214
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,770
I still love you.

215
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,610
So much.

216
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,020
So much.

217
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,620
I'm not calling her.

218
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,220
Schmidt, I know you really want to go to this party,

219
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,410
but wouldn't it be better

220
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,640
to find a girl who you really care about to motorboat?

221
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,130
Then maybe, if you're super-lucky,

222
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,230
you might find a girl who will motorboat you right back.

223
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,680
I don't think she knows what motorboating is.

224
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,390
Beers and a ros?

225
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,050
Pink wine makes me... slutty.

226
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,390
Whoa. Cute-guy alert.

227
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,510
Okay, Jess, game time. Let's do this.

228
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,010
You want to forget about Spencer,

229
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,560
you're gonna have to do some very, very bad things...

230
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,850
With that man right over there.

231
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,870
How bad?

232
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,230
Real bad, Jess.

233
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,900
Like, uh, make-out session, no tops.

234
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,690
Okay, this is what... this is what's gonna happen.

235
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,330
Y-you're gonna go over there.

236
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,850
You're gonna stand next to him, and you're gonna smile.

237
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,770
You're not gonna smile like that.

238
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,920
You look like a hungry badger.

239
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,390
Stop that.

240
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,710
O-okay, I got this. I got this.

241
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,190
You got... you got it. Just go make it happen.

242
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,420
Get 'em up! Grind it out!

243
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,650
Go do it! Grind it out!

244
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,200
Hey, sailor.

245
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,295
Oh. All right. That's okay.

246
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:41,380
You can come back from that.

247
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,860
Maybe he didn't hear that.You're all good.

248
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,600
Holy Schmidt! It's Schmidt!

249
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,020
Oh, it is all about the Benjamin!

250
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,820
- What's up?!
- What's up, man?

251
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,880
All right. P-funk, what's up, dude?

252
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:52,740
This is Coach.

253
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,830
What's up, coach?

254
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,510
You like parties?

255
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,350
Don't talk to me.

256
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,070
Yeah, okay.

257
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,580
You know who likes to party hard, right?

258
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,040
So, you coming on Saturday?

259
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,280
I hear there's gonna be some fine ladies there.

260
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,230
Uh, maybe. Yeah.

261
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,210
I heard it's not gonna be that good this year. No?

262
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,630
Are you not on the list?

263
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,760
Man, I'm on the...list. You know that.

264
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,880
Ah, that sucks, man.

265
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,090
Keep your head up, all right?

266
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,240
All right, playa.

267
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,850
Do your thing, man. It was good seeing you.

268
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,390
All right, man. P-funk, always.

269
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,800
- Nick, please.
- Why are you friends with those guys?

270
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,040
Nick, please get me in the party.

271
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,440
I'm begging you, please.

272
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,590
No, I'm not calling Caroline.

273
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,980
Do you know what a cute cowboy I am? Do you have any idea?

274
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,270
Well, I guess I can't hide my crazy.

275
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,370
I don't think you're trying that hard.

276
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,810
Well, I've never really been great at this stuff, so...

277
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,500
What if god was one of us?

278
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,810
Make it stop!

279
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,910
Just a slob like one of us

280
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,660
Look at us... couple of losers.

281
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,180
We both got dumped.

282
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,090
Geesh.

283
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,460
I'm fine.

284
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,340
It was six months ago, so...

285
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,650
Do you know why she dumped you?

286
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,420
I mean, she must have hurt you pretty bad.

287
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,940
No, no. It made no difference to me.

288
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,770
I just wanted to set her trash cans on fire.

289
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,550
So you're always just, like, wondering, like, "What was it?

290
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,100
Was there something I could have done differently?"

291
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,930
You know what happens to people who keep it all inside?

292
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,030
They get old and they get sad and they get weird,

293
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,060
and then you're the old man, and you're yelling at the kids

294
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,410
who are running across your yard,

295
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,830
and you're telling them, "Don't run across my yard.

296
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,440
My life's filled with regret."

297
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,290
You know, you can't just pretend like it didn't happen.

298
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,860
Or I could pretend to be more like you, Jess,

299
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,120
And live on a sparkly rainbow

300
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,790
and drive a unicorn around and just sing all the time.

301
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,900
Yeah, I think you should sing all the time.

302
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,100
No, I was being mean. I'm not gonna do that, Jess.

303
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,010
Why not? It's fun.

304
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,600
Because I have a penis.

305
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,690
My name is Nick? I have a penis

306
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,910
And I'm not gonna let any feelings out

307
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,010
Okay, Jess...

308
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,610
Your left boob is resting on a plate of chicken wings.

309
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,690
Yeah. I know.

310
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,290
Hey.

311
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,850
I'm Peter.

312
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,750
What are you drinking?

313
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,030
Oh, I'll have another pink wine.

314
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,860
I like your glasses.

315
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,170
They help me see.

316
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,040
She's doing all right.

317
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,700
Schmidt stain!

318
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,520
Hey, man, I was thinking...

319
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,870
It's probably better that you don't come to the party.

320
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,530
That means more breasts for me.

321
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,740
You better step down, son.

322
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,070
You're taking this whole thing too far.

323
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,530
I'm seri... hold me back, Coach.

324
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,680
I-I'm serious. Hold me back. Hold me back!

325
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,540
- Coach, would you please hold me back?
- No.

326
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,970
Schmidt, we're going to the party. Relax.

327
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,170
Nice. See you there, Schmidty.

328
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,790
Ah, totally, broseph!

329
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,460
Yeah, I texted Caroline.

330
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,680
You texted Caroline?

331
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,410
Thank you. I love you, bro.

332
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,710
Yeah. There it is.

333
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,110
Did you just kiss my arm a little?

334
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,440
You bet I did. It felt right.

335
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,390
So, I'll see you tomorrow, sailor.

336
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,800
Yeah, cool. I'll call... cool.

337
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,790
What's happening tomorrow, sailor?

338
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,800
You know what? You guys were totally right.

339
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,700
I talked in short sentences, I didn't sing,

340
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,060
I laughed, I smiled, I said I needed rebound sex,

341
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,990
and it totally worked. He asked me out.

342
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,420
Dinner...with food.

343
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,050
- I'm so proud of you.
- You got it, girl.

344
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,340
You did good. Yeah, you put it...

345
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,360
Date!

346
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,410
It's Jess!

347
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,460
She's on fire

348
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,210
She's on fire

349
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,570
She got some big panties!

350
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,780
All right, should we tell her?

351
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,720
Ah, I think we let her have her moment.

352
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,360
Do the shoes fit, Jess?

353
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,110
I'm okay!

354
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,030
What, are you a model or something?

355
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,740
Yeah.

356
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,130
Yes, mostly print right now, so...

357
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,200
What is it... Cece? Cecelia?

358
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,740
"Chechelia"?

359
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,450
Tell me, what are your hopes and dreams?

360
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,300
You know, are you warm? I'm a little I'm a little warm right now.

361
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,280
Don't, Schmidt.

362
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,410
All right.

363
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,210
Oh, yeah, there it is.

364
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,280
Please put your shirt back on.

365
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,070
Please don't make me laugh at you.

366
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,650
Can I hit you up with some tea? A little herb tea?

367
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,870
Oh, my god.

368
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,850
How good is that? For real. What?

369
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,520
Little p-mint tea?

370
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,160
Yum, right?

371
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,320
Hot, sweet.

372
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,430
Little tea-bag action.

373
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,530
I wasn't talking about...

374
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,670
There it is.

375
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,080
Douchebag.

376
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,380
Listen to me, you guys.

377
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,420
Jess is by far the best person that I know.

378
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,580
So if you guys let anything happen to her,

379
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,410
I'm gonna come here and crazy murder you.

380
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,020
I'm gonna be honest with you.

381
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,690
I did not hear a word that you just said,

382
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,990
'cause I can kinda see your party hats right now.

383
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,690
Here you go.

384
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,280
Jess!

385
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,620
Why are you talking like this?

386
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,270
- I fell off my heels.
- Okay. All right.

387
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,790
No. Come on. Get up.

388
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,240
Oh, what am I doing?

389
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,180
I can't go on a date. What if it's horrible?

390
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,730
What if I have nothing to talk about?

391
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,590
Then you go to the bathroom and you call me

392
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,900
and you tell me all about it.

393
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,810
Maybe I just shouldn't go.

394
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,330
Babe, you got hurt.

395
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,080
That doesn't mean you stop trying.

396
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,010
Okay?

397
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,680
Okay. Let's go. Come on.

398
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,270
You got to take off those overalls.

399
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,280
I was going for, like, a...

400
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,500
Like a "Hot farmer's daughter" kind of thing.

401
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,800
You know, like...

402
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,060
"I'm going to go milk my cows...

403
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,580
With my bucket."

404
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,070
Take them off.

405
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,500
Okay.

406
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,220
What am I gonna wear?

407
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,260
Thanks, Coach.

408
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,260
And then she does that.

409
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,910
I'm gonna text him, tell him I'm headed over.

410
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,480
Wait. Have you been texting him?

411
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,520
Is that bad?

412
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,080
No. It's nice.

413
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,060
Have a good night.

414
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,940
This is gonna be great.

415
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,670
Coach, you don't look anything like an indian.

416
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,820
Look, man, I got your back. You got to have mine, too.

417
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,030
Coach, I got your back.

418
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,710
No, Nick, I want to hear it from him.

419
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,080
Coach, what sort of indian wears bike shorts?

420
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,530
Excuse me, is, uh, Caroline... I'm looking for Caroline.

421
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,810
We're supposed to be on some list.

422
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,610
Hey. Nick.

423
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,910
That's her.

424
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,000
Sorry. I'm wearing this stupid thing.

425
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,350
Schmidt made me do it.

426
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,780
Thank you so much for getting us in.

427
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,940
Yeah. No problem.

428
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,320
Um, maybe to pay me back, you can stop prank-calling me.

429
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:39,930
What?

430
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,610
'Ello, Caroline.

431
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,410
I still loves you, I do.

432
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,630
Yeah, you got to figure that out.

433
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,300
Some crazy person's calling you.

434
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,700
You look nice. It's good to see you.

435
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,500
I-I think I'm almost finished out here if you...

436
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,250
Do you want to go... grab a drink?

437
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,400
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

438
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,930
Sure. Yeah.

439
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,900
Let's you and I just get a drink, be normal about it.

440
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,800
Actually, hold on. I'm sorry. I just...

441
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,120
I have to ask you something so that one day

442
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,830
I'm not an old man filled with regret.

443
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,570
But why did you dump me?

444
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,880
Do... okay, are we doing this here, like, now?

445
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,970
Yeah.

446
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,240
Why did you dump me?

447
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,800
Honestly, I-I didn't even realize that you cared about me

448
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,590
until we broke up.

449
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,520
Okay.

450
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,950
Let's get that drink.

451
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,450
Get along, little doggie!

452
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,870
Well, howdy, there, muchachos.

453
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,470
Hey, where's Jess?

454
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,830
Oh, dude, she texted me seven times...

455
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,450
Like, long ones.

456
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,850
I just wanted to hook up.

457
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,180
So, is she waiting for you to show up, or did you call her?

458
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,590
Yeah, that's what I did. I called her.

459
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,370
Stay in touch, Schmidt!

460
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,020
Nick.

461
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,910
Want to get that drink?

462
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,830
No, I got to go help a friend, Caroline.

463
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,610
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

464
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,920
Guys, this is the party of the year, you guys.

465
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,340
This is our night. This is our night!

466
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,710
I'm going with Nick, man. You coming?

467
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,070
I thought you guys were my boys!

468
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,930
"Boys" is not a thing, Schmidt! Stop!

469
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,580
Do you have anything else

470
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,360
that is free but also has bread in it?

471
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,070
Because the... the, like, good bread, I ate,

472
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,230
and that's... all that's left is like a...

473
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,260
It's like... it's kind of like a health bread.

474
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,680
I'm sorry.

475
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,890
We're gonna have to ask you to give up the table.

476
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,680
Can I please just stay just a little bit longer?

477
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,950
We're here!

478
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,810
Yeah!

479
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,490
We're here, Jess! We're here.

480
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,750
Here for the date... date thing.

481
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:20,710
You're all on a date?

482
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,730
Yeah. We, uh, we're her boyfriends.

483
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,260
We are reverse mormons.

484
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,460
- One man just isn't enough for her.
- Okay.

485
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,260
Hey, Jess, that guy was a jerk.

486
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,860
The guy's a clown.

487
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,700
You guys missed your party to come here and...

488
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,260
see me?

489
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,230
Yeah. We, uh... we care about you.

490
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,900
We like you.

491
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,510
That's so nice!

492
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,680
What is that?

493
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,280
- Don't start crying.
- Come on.

494
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,130
It's cool. It's very, very cool.

495
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,450
Come on, Jess. Come on.

496
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,750
- Please...
- Stop it!

497
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,090
It's okay. Hey, don't cry.

498
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:00,860
For I've had the time of my life

499
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:01,630
What is he doing?

500
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,960
And I've never felt this way before

501
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,640
Yes, it's true

502
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,310
And it's something something something

503
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,760
There's bears in my house

504
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,970
And it's the song that makes you really, really happy

505
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,540
I'm not, uh, I'm not participating in this.

506
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,210
Just remember

507
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,670
You're the one thing

508
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,530
I can't get enough of

509
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,650
And I'll tell you something

510
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,610
This could be love, because

511
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,140
- I've had - Had

512
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,450
The time of my life

513
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,840
And I owe it all to you

514
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,370
Come on! What time is it?!

515
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,290
The time of my life

516
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,200
You have to leave... now. All of you.

517
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,020
Seriously, thank you, guys, so much for tonight.

518
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,430
That was really cool.

519
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:18,980
Listen, Jess,

520
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,050
I just want you to know that...

521
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,150
I mean, for me, at least,

522
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,010
n-no matter what...

523
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,870
I would still totally do you.

524
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,750
Oh, that's so sweet.

525
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,310
Yeah. Absolutely.

526
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,850
- Jar.
- Yeah. Jar.
